I am a Master Degree Computer Science student who spends most of his time on Python/C++ projects and occasionaly have fun with ESP8266/Arduino Board. For both of my thesis (bachelor and master) I have worked on compilers, respectively: LLVM and STAQ. For both of them the final aim was adding more backends, but for STAQ compiler I had to target quantum computers's hardware. In my free time I love to play videogames and listening to music. I collect old deck player, vintage amplifier and records. When I travel I love to take pictures with my Nikon D90 or my Lumix G6.
